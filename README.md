# Inventory-Optimisation

1. Define the Problem
The main objective is to create a model that can predict inventory needs, optimize stock levels, and reduce carrying costs while avoiding stockouts.
This involves forecasting demand and making inventory decisions based on those forecasts.

2. Data Requirements
To train a deep learning model for inventory management, you need a diverse set of data. Here are the essential types of data:
Historical Sales Data:
Product ID
Date of sale
Quantity sold
Price at the time of sale
Discounts applied
Inventory Data:
Stock levels
Reorder points
Lead times
Inventory turnover rates
Product Information:
Category
Brand
Attributes (e.g., size, color, weight)
Price
Shelf life (for perishable goods)
Promotional Data:
Advertising campaigns
Discounts and offers
Seasonal promotions
Customer Data:
Demographics
Purchase history
Customer segmentation
Market and Competitor Data:
Market trends
Competitor pricing
New product launches
External Data:
Economic indicators (e.g., inflation rate, consumer confidence)
Social media trends
Weather data (if relevant to sales)

3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Collection
Gather data from internal ERP systems, CRM systems, and external sources.
Ensure data consistency and completeness.
Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
Normalization: Scale numerical data to ensure uniformity.
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data to capture important patterns (e.g., average sales per month, customer lifetime value).

4. Model Building
Step 1: Define the Problem
Frame it as a multi-task learning problem where the model predicts both sales quantity and optimal inventory levels.
Step 2: Choose the Model Architecture
Consider using models like RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) for time series data.
Use feedforward neural networks or CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for feature extraction and regression tasks.
Step 3: Prepare the Data for Training
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Time Series Split: Ensure the split respects the temporal order if using time series data.
Step 4: Train the Model
Model Compilation: Choose appropriate loss functions and optimizers. For regression tasks, mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) are common choices. Adam or RMSprop can be used as optimizers.
Model Training: Fit the model to the training data. Monitor performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for your model. This may include tuning the learning rate, number of layers, number of units per layer, dropout rates, etc.
Step 5: Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model on the test set using relevant metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE, and RÂ² (coefficient of determination). These metrics will give you an idea of how well the model is predicting sales and inventory needs.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. Time series cross-validation can be used to maintain temporal order.
Model Interpretability: Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or feature importance scores to understand which features are most influential in the model's predictions.
Step 6: Model Deployment
Model Export: Save the trained model using formats such as H5 (for TensorFlow/Keras models) or Pickle (for scikit-learn models).
API Creation: Develop an API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to serve the model predictions. The API can take input data (current inventory levels, sales data, etc.) and return predicted inventory needs.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Set up monitoring to track the model's performance in a production environment. Regularly retrain the model with new data to ensure it remains accurate.
